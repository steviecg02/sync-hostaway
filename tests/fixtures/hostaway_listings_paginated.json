    "description": "Nestled in Syracuse's safe and sought-after Tipperary Hill, this beautifully restored 1900 house combines old-world charm with modern comforts. Ideal for adults, friends, contractors, and business travelers, it's minutes from all destinations, including SU and all hospitals. A short walk to many food and beverage spots. Enjoy this charming sanctuary with upscale design, a cozy enclosed porch, deck, fireplace, elegant bedrooms, dedicated office/laundry, and a gourmet kitchen. Your ideal retreat.\n\nIt's important to note that, like many older homes, there may be some noise transfer between apartments, and you might occasionally encounter creaky or slightly uneven floors in certain areas. If these factors are a concern, we recommend considering alternative accommodation options. Guests are kindly requested to review and accept the house rules.\n\n-\n\nUpon entering this exquisite downstairs apartment, you'll discover a cozy living room featuring a large, comfortable couch and two swivel chairs surrounding the spacious coffee table. These chairs are perfect for participating in conversations throughout the apartment. The TV is adjustable, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience from any spot within the room. An electric fireplace, nestled beneath the TV, allows you to create a warm and inviting ambiance during colder months with customizable settings, including various color options.\n\nIn warmer seasons, step from the living room into the charming enclosed porch. This area is perfect for savoring your morning coffee while watching the sunrise or capturing the sunset. You can open the storm windows during a thunderstorm or enjoy a refreshing breeze. The space includes a comfortable patio set, providing an ideal spot for relaxation.\n\nOff the living room, you'll find the extra-large main bedroom, featuring a king-size bed for the utmost comfort. There's also a beautifully appointed second bedroom with a queen-sized bed. Guests have raved about the luxurious mattress we've provided, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep.

Ideal for adults, friends, contractors, and business travelers, it's minutes from all destinations, including SU and all hospitals. A short walk to many food and beverage spots. Enjoy this charming sanctuary with upscale design, a cozy enclosed porch, deck, fireplace, elegant bedrooms, dedicated office/laundry, and a gourmet kitchen. Your ideal retreat.\n\nIt's important to note that, like many older homes, there may be some noise transfer between apartments, and you might occasionally encounter creaky or slightly uneven floors in certain areas. If these factors are a concern, we recommend considering alternative accommodation options. Guests are kindly requested to review and accept the house rules.\n\n-\n\nUpon entering this exquisite upstairs apartment, you'll discover a cozy living room adorned with 9-foot ceilings and elegant crown molding. This timeless charm extends throughout the front rooms, including the main bedroom and office. \n\nThe living room features a large, comfortable leather couch and additional seating, creating a cozy atmosphere ideal for reading and relaxation. The TV is adjustable, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience from any vantage point within the room. \n\nAn electric fireplace, nestled beneath the TV, allows you to create a warm and inviting ambiance during colder months with customizable settings, including various color options.\n\nIn warmer seasons, step from the living room into the charming enclosed porch. Facing east, this area is perfect for savoring your morning coffee while watching the sunrise. Open the storm windows during a thunderstorm or let in a refreshing breeze. The space includes a comfortable patio set, providing an ideal spot for relaxation.\n\nOff the living room, you'll find the extra-large main bedroom, featuring a king-size bed for the utmost comfort. Guests have raved about the luxurious mattress we've provided, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep. Additionally, you'll discover a closet and a dresser with an oversized mirror. Our top-notch bedding guarantees a restful night's sleep.

It's fully equipped with everything you need to prepare delicious meals. Adjacent to the dining room table, you'll discover the back stairs leading to another exit and access to the laundry facilities in the basement. Outside of the back exit, there's a small deck and patio set for enjoying meals outdoors, which is shared with the downstairs apartment.\n\nThe second bedroom is thoughtfully designed with a comfortable queen-size bed and a spacious walk-in closet. You'll enjoy the same comfortable mattress found in the main bedroom.\n\nToward the back of the house is an elegant bathroom featuring a clawfoot tub and timeless fixtures. It's a spacious area where you can unwind with a relaxing soak in the tub, complete with a bubble bath. Treat yourself to a glass of wine and experience true relaxation in this beautifully designed space.\n\nParking: Please use the left side of the driveway.\nEntrance: Utilize the left-hand door to access the apartment.\n\nOff-Limits Areas:\n\n1st-floor apartment and porch\nAttic\n\nBefore booking or during your stay, please feel free to reach out if you have any special requests or specific needs.

Green Beer Sunday kicks off the festivities traditionally on the last Sunday of February at Coleman's Authentic Irish Pub. And, for those searching for fitness and fun there\u2019s the annual Shamrock 4-mile run that also celebrates the beautiful hilly landscape of the area.\n\nKindly remember, this is a home, not a hotel.
